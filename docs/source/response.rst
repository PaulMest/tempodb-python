Responses
=========

The :mod:`tempodb.response` module contains functionality for working with 
responses from the TempoDB API.  A :class:`Response` object is ultimately 
returned by every method call to the :class:`tempodb.client.Client` class.  Its 
"data" attribute will vary according to the type of response expected from the 
API.
